#Graph

Principles:
1. Provide a simple graph framework so users can extend the library in such as indexer, data store, sorting and traversal.
2. Provide some default options for indexer, data store, sorting and traversal so the library can work out of the box.

Thoughts:
1. Looking into building blocks for a small simple graph DB, work with single server & distributed system.
2. Container and kubernetes focus
3. Interface with industry standard such as Apache TinkerPop, GraphQL, RestAPI, GRPC.
4. Learn from experience of Dgraph
